<p> Welcome. In this experiment you will be asked to read some sentences. First you will see some lines like this:</p>

<p> _____ _______ ________ ___________ _____________ __________ </p>

<p> These dashes are covering the words in the sentence.  When you press the space bar, the first word will appear.  With every press of the space bar, a new word will appear. You should try to read as naturally as possible, making sure that you understand what you read. </p> 

<p> You will then be asked answer a question regarding what you just read. Press "1" to pick the first answer. Press "2" to pick the second answer. Press "3" to pick the third answer. </p> 

<p> Try to answer as quickly and accurately as possible. If you are unsure of the response (or if you think that more than one is right), try to pick the best answer. </p> 

<p> To be able to read and answer quickly, you should keep one hand resting over the space bar and the other hand hand resting over the "1", "2", and "3" keys, so that you don't have to look down at the keys to answer. </p> 


<p> That's all there is to it.  Just to review, this is how the experiment goes: 

<ol>
	<li> Some dashes will appear on the screen and you must press the space bar to see each new word of the sentence.</li>

	<li> Read at a natural rate, comprehending what you read.  Don't read out loud unless that's the way you normally read.</li>

	<li> You'll see a multiple-choice question about the sentence and you should answer by pressing either the "1" key, the "2" key, or the "3" key, depending on what you think the right answer is.  You will be told if your answer was incorrect.  You should take this as an indication to read more slowly and carefully.</li>

	<li>After the question, the computer will automatically go on to the next sentence.</li>

</ol>

<p> When the experiment is over, a screen will appear telling you to stop.  At that point, you you are finished! </p>
